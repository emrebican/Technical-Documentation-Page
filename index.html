                    <h2>About</h2>
                    <p>Material Design (codenamed Quantum Paper)[5] is a design language developed by Google in 2014. Expanding on the "cards" that debuted in Google Now, Material Design uses more grid-based layouts, responsive animations and transitions, padding, and depth effects such as lighting and shadows. Google announced Material Design on June 25, 2014, at the 2014 Google I/O conference.</p>

                            <i class="tiny material-icons">fiber_manual_record</i>
                            <p>
                                The main purpose of Material Design is the creation of a new visual language that combines principles of good design with technical and scientific innovation. Designer Mat√≠as Duarte explained that, "unlike real paper, our digital material can expand and reform intelligently. Material has physical surfaces and edges. Seams and shadows provide meaning about what you can touch." Google states that their new design language is based on paper and ink but implementation takes place in an advanced manner.

                            <p>
                                In 2018, Google detailed a revamp of the language, with a focus on providing more flexibility for designers to create custom "themes" with varying geometry, colors, and typography. Google released Material Theme Editor exclusively for the macOS design application Sketch.

                    <h2>Implementation</h2>
                    <p>Material Design was to be gradually extended throughout Google's array of web and mobile products, providing a consistent experience across all platforms and applications. Google has also released application programming interfaces (APIs) for third-party developers to incorporate the design language into their applications.</p>

                            <p>
                                The canonical implementation of Material Design for web application user interfaces is called Polymer.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                It consists of the Polymer library, a shim that provides a Web Components API for browsers that do not implement the standard natively, and an elements catalog, including the "paper elements collection" that features visual elements of the Material Design.Google also has created an accompanying icon set licensed under the Apache 2.0 license.

                            <h4>Material is the metaphor</h4>
                            <p>The metaphor of material defines the relationship between space and motion. The idea is that the technology is inspired by paper and ink and is utilized to facilitate creativity and innovation. Surfaces and edges provide familiar visual cues that allow users to quickly understand the technology beyond the physical world.</p>

                            <p>Elements and components such as grids, typography, color, and imagery are not only visually pleasing, but also create a sense of hierarchy, meaning, and focus. Emphasis on different actions and components create a visual guide for users.</p>

                            <p>Motion allows the user to draw a parallel between what they see on the screen and in real life. By providing both feedback and familiarity, this allows the user to fully immerse him or herself into unfamiliar technology. Motion contains consistency and continuity in addition to giving users additional subconscious information about objects and transformations.</p>

                    <h2>Getting Started</h2>
                    <h3>DownLoad</h3>
                    <p>Materialize comes in two different forms. You can select which version you want depending on your preference and expertise. To start using Materialize, all you have to do is download one of the options below.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <i class="tiny material-icons">fiber_manual_record</i>
                            <div class="content">
                                <h4>Materialize</h4>
                                <p>
                                    This is the standard version that comes with both the minified and unminified CSS and JavaScript files. This option requires little to no setup. Use this if you are unfamiliar with Sass.
                                </p>
                                <button class="btn">MATERIALIZE</button>
                            </div>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <i class="tiny material-icons">fiber_manual_record</i>

                                <p>
                                    This version contains the source SCSS files. By choosing this version you have more control over which components to include. You will need a Sass compiler if you choose this option.
                                </p>

                    <p>You can find all the versions of the CDN at cdnjs.</p>
        
                    <h2 id="npm">NPM</h2>
                    <p>You can also get the latest release using NPM. This release contains source files as well as the compiled CSS and JavaScript files.</p>

                        function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
                        greetMe("World");
                    </code>
        
                    <h2 id="bower">Bower</h2>
                    <p>You can also get the latest release using bower. This release contains source files as well as the compiled CSS and JavaScript files.</p>
                    <code>
                        bower install materialize
                    </code>
                    <h3 id="setup">Setup</h3>
                    <h4>Project Structure</h4>
                    <p>After downloading, extract the files into the directory where your website is located. Your directory will look something like this.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <i class="tiny material-icons">fiber_manual_record</i>
                                <p>
                                    You'll notice that there are two sets of the files. The <code>min</code> means that the file is "compressed" to reduce load times.
                                </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <i class="tiny material-icons">fiber_manual_record</i>
                                <p>
                                    These minified files are usually used in production while it is better to use the unminified files during development.
                                </p>
                            </li>

                        <p>Next you just have to make sure you link the files properly in your webpage. Generally it is wise to import javascript files at the end of the body to reduce page load time. Follow the example below on how to import Materialize into your webpage.</p>

                    <h4>Compiling Sass</h4>

                            <p>
                                Instead of having a css folder, you will find that the download instead contains many .scss files which contain the styles of individual components.
                            </p>
                        </li>

                                Unfortunately, the browser cannot interpret Sass, so you must have your Sass compiler compile the scss/materialize.scss into a regular CSS file. At this point you can link this newly outputted file in your HTML page.
